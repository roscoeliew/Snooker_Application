        <p>Here are the instructions to play the game:</p>
        <p>In this Snooker App, you can enjoy the classic game of snooker with a digital twist. Utilize your mouse to place and strike the cue ball, aiming for the red and colored balls to score points according to snooker rules.</p>

        <p>There are 3 different modes on this Snooker App:</p>
        <p><strong>Mode 1: Standard Snooker Game</strong> - This mode follows the traditional rules of snooker. Start with the red balls and then move on to the colors, scoring points for each potted ball. Press the <strong>'1'</strong> key to activate this mode.</p>
        <p><strong>Mode 2: Random Ball Snooker Game</strong> - In this mode, red balls are placed in random positions on the table. It's a fun way to practice potting reds from various angles. Press the <strong>'2'</strong> key to shuffle and activate this mode.</p>
        <p><strong>Mode 3: Random Red Ball Snooker Game</strong> - This mode places only the red balls in random positions, challenging you to strategize your approach to the colors. Press the <strong>'3'</strong> key to mix up the reds and start this mode.</p>
          
        <p><strong>Mode 4: Timed Pocket Challenge</strong> - In this mode, players face a 3-minute time challenge with only three randomly selected pockets active at any given time. Press the <strong>'4'</strong> key to start the timer and engage in this strategic and skill-focused challenge. Aim to pocket as many balls as possible within the time limit, adapting your strategy to the changing active pockets. When the timer runs out, the game ends with your final score based on the balls pocketed in active pockets.</p>
